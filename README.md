# ProjectManagement

## Introduction

A monorepo project I am taking on solo to really push myself to do something fullstack and completely in TypeScript. The concept is a Project Management System. It will start out very simple and once the system has reached a point that it can be used to track basic project milestones, I will then use it as a way to track its own growth. There are still plenty of unknown unknowns as I make the approach to design and build this about what specific technology with the TypeScript ecosystem will be involved or how I will handle authentication or whether I'll work in a way to handle multi-tenancy. I just want to have an enjoyable time working through frustrations and observing my own internal growth as I implement features in my own program.
